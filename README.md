- I’m currently working on personal projects related to cybersecurity, networking, and automation
-  I’m currently learning cybersecurity fundamentals, network protocols, and traffic analysis
-  I’m looking to collaborate on security tools, automation scripts, or backend projects
-  I’m looking for help with improving my skills in real-world security testing and network monitoring
-  Ask me about programming, networks, cybersecurity basics, or Linux
-  How to reach me: GitHub messages
-  Fun fact: I enjoy understanding how systems break just as much as how they work
